To this day, the fiducial Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model still competes against alternative models that can potentially alleviate some tensions found with LCDM. 
A novel way to constrain dark matter models is possible through measuring the kinematic signatures of atomic hydrogen (HI) in galaxies. 
The 21-cm emission line of HI gas is broadened due to a galaxy's rotation. 
The extent of such broadening in a given galaxy is sensitive to the size, and hence mass of the dark matter halo hosting the gas.
The use of HI gas a visible tracer for the dark matter distribution allows us to connect the dark universe to measurable quantities.
