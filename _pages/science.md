### DARK MATTER PARADIGMS

To this day, the fiducial Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model still competes against alternative models that can potentially alleviate some tensions found with LCDM. 
A novel way to constrain dark matter models is possible through measuring the kinematic signatures of atomic hydrogen (HI) in galaxies. 
The 21-cm emission line of HI gas is broadened due to a galaxy's rotation. 
The extent of such broadening in a given galaxy is sensitive to the size, and hence mass of the dark matter halo hosting the gas.
The use of HI gas a visible tracer for the dark matter distribution allows us to connect the dark universe to measurable quantities. [Brooks, Oman & Frenk](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522.4043B/abstract)

### STELLAR STREAMS & GALAXY MERGER WITH THE LMC

The dark matter halo of a galaxy has an abundance substructure.
This substructure results from the process of accreting material from smaller satellite galaxies. 
Debris from the satellites is tidally stripped by the central galaxy, forming long tidal streams of stars. 
These structures are of interest as they reveal something about the gravitational potential of the central galaxy,
and hence the underlying dark matter distribution.

Perturbations to the gravitational potential over time can be investigated using streams. 
Particularly those that pass close to the source of the perturbation. 
Of note is the recent major merger of the Milky Way with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). 

Modelling tidal streams is often a complex process in phase-space coordinates. An alternative approach is to model streams in the action-angle space. By transformation to this canonical coordinate system, the actions represent constants of motion along a particle's orbit in the host galaxy's potential, while the angles determine the position of the particle through its orbit. The time-dependent nature of the Milky Way's history raises the question that these actions may not be invariant over time as thought to be in the time-independent histories

The evolution and properties of a galaxy are strongly influenced by merger events.
Within the Local Group, the MW is undergoing a merger with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). 
The LMC is thought to be on its first pericentric passage and has a merger ratio with the Milky Way (MW) of ~1:8. 
The LMC has been observed to generate significant disequilibrium in the MW gravitational potential, 
e.g. displacing the MW disc, creating a stellar over-density, and generating the reflex motion of the stellar halo. 

Due to the merger with the LMC, the potential of the MW is unlikely to be invariant and will deform non-linearly. 
Basis function expansions (BFEs) act to reduce non-linear systems to linear ones by the transformation to a well-motivated choice of basis functions. 
As such, BFEs offer the flexibility to model the deformations of the dark matter haloes captured in N-body simulations. 
The MW-LMC N-body simulations of Lilleengen et al. 2023 infer a BFE description using the EXP toolkit. 

The harmonic orders of the BFE will develop over the entire simulation. 
At the beginning of the live simulation, and for all prior times, 
there has yet to be any response of the MW's dark matter halo due to the passage of the LMC. 
The in-fall of the LMC as the satellite galaxy onto the MW as the central host generates density wakes. 
The classical `conic' wake trailing the LMC is described as the transient response, whereas the response elsewhere in the MW halo is the collective response.
In the below animation, you can see the temporal development of the MW halo density contrast due to the LMC's passage for both isolated harmonic subsets and the full basis expansion simulation of the MW--LMC simulation.
