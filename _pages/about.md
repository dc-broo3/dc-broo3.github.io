I am a PhD student at in the astrophysics group at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/richard-brooks-phd-student) supervised by Jason Sanders and Andrew Pontzen. My research focus is on galaxy dynamics, both local to the Milky Way and in applications to external galaxies.

Away from research, I'm a passionate Newcastle United fan!
